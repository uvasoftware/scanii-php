A pure PHP interface to Scanii, a web based virus scanning engine (http://scanii.com) 

Requirements:
	1. getopt
	2. curl 
	3. PHP5 (may work with php4)

Using it:
	1. Go to scanii.com and sign up for an API key 
	2. Once armed with your API key and secret, you can run by replacing KEY and SECRET with the proper
	information 
	3. You can run the command line driver like this:

	$ php scanii.php -c "KEY:SECRET"  -f ~/tmp/eicar.com
	using key: KEY and secret: SECRET
	scanning file: /Users/rafael/tmp/eicar.com
	file /Users/rafael/tmp/eicar.com is infected, virus: Eicar-Test-Signature

	
		
Import things to note:
	1. This client can also be used as a standalone library in your application
	2. You can store your credentials in a environment variable called SCANII_CRED 
	3. The license is MIT/X11 so use it and abuse it :)
